App Brainstorming

My favorite features of these apps are:

Facebook

- A variety of entertainment sections such as videos, games, messenger, marketplace and dating place
- Multiple options such as layouts, music, tag people, locations and feelings for uploading customized posts and story
- Available to mute, hide, except and block to protect the users' privacy


Rate My Professors

- Comparing for facilities, services, and opportunities with any colleges we want
- Available to give like or dislike emoji for each ratings of the professors
-  Share the anonymous rating and the popped up advertisement style without distracting the users


LinkedIn

- Transforming the profile into the resume that could be used to apply for professional jobs
- Adding a note as a self-introduction along with the friend request to other professionals
- Available to read articles about the various job industries, tips and tricks for the job interviews and applications


Google Maps

- Street suggestions when we type in the search bar
- Exploring nearby restaurants, hotels, gas stations, and more
- Ability to save favorite places and create custom maps.


The app I would like to build is called the RateMyHotel. The main purpose of this app is to get an insight about different hotel facilities and services and compare their expenses through the app to get the best customer experience. I want to implement the features such as anonymous ratings and reviews including images for any hotels (firstly in the US and later in the world), nearby places recommendations and directions for them, user guide and policy for the app, the artices or blogs about how to choose the best hotel with your budget, types of hotels, and tips and tricks about traveling to a new place or a country.
